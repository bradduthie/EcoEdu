EcoEdu: An educational tool for modelling population dynamics
================================================================================

********************************************************************************

> **The [EcoEdu repository](https://github.com/bradduthie/EcoEdu) includes files used for learning about model inference and model development in ecology. The goal of the software is to serve as a tool to help students think more clearly about how populations change over time, and why and how we can use modelling to develop ecological theory and predict ecological patterns. Specifically, this software models predator-prey interactions using both classic Lotka-Volterra numerical simulation and individual-based model simulation.**

The best way to use this softare is through its [Shiny application](https://bradduthie.shinyapps.io/EcoEdu/). A [worksheet](http://bradduthie.github.io/BI4803_LabPractical.html) is also available to introduce the software and suggest helpful exercises. Finally, a [simplified version](https://github.com/bradduthie/EcoEdu/blob/master/Eco_Mod_IBM.R) of the underlying R code is available for exploration in the GitHub repository.
