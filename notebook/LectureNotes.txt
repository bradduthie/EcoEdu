Title slide:

- Interested in modelling how populations change over time
- Population is a group of individuals of the same species in some area
  - E.g., humans in Aberdeen are a population
  - Seagulls in Aberdeen are a population

Modelling population dynamics:

- Models look at how the density of species changes
  - Discrete time approach looks at `chunks' of time
    - e.g., one year to the next; one season to the next
    - Tend to be more intuitive when learning modelling
    - Also easier to compare with another type of model (IBM)
  - Continuous time models assumes time passes smoothly
    - Use calculus to project continuous growth
- We'll assume all individuals are the same (though could model age, etc.)
- Goal to predict population growth, but also *understand* dynamics

Logistic population growth:

- Species density at time t+1 is just density at t + change
  - *Ask* what are some things that can change density?
  - Mention all, but note we'll only talk about birth and death

Logistic population growth II:

- Just the present population density plus net change in growth
  - Per capita net change from t \to t+1 is R
  - Examples of R
  - *Ask* is this growth realistic? (lead into K)

Logistic growth (lab practical software):

- Briefly point out some of the features
- Predator-prey dynamics are coming on the next slide
